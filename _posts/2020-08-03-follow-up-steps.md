Testing out new skincare products can either be an exciting experience or an uneasy venture. Depending on the product, the skin may require a period of adjustment before achieving results of radiant skin. It can seem like a toss between emotions as we wait for glowy skin results or the reveal of a dreadful break out.  Here are some helpful tips on the best follow up steps that can help enhance your skincare experience and make the transition as smooth as possible. 

## Exfoliation + Ceramides

Recommendation: Follow up with a moisturizer with ceramides. Additional hydrating ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, betaine, and glycerin will also help calm the skin.

## Retinoid + SPF

![](\assets\images\active.jpg)As retinoid based products work to increase cell turnover of the skin, the surface of the skin sheds more quickly. During this time the skin can become more sensitive to sun exposure. 

Recommendation: Stick to the basics and follow-up with a soothing, gentle routine. Apply SPF of 30 or greater during the day.

## Low dosage AHAs and BHAs + Vitamin C

However, a low dosage of AHAs and BHAs can help gently exfoliate the top layer of the skin for Vitamin C to work more effectively. 

Recommendation: Use a toner containing chemical exfoliant (AHA, BHA, or AHA and BHA) followed by a Vitamin C serum.

## Hyaluronic Acid + Occlusives

Applying an additional layer of product containing occlusives on the skin can minimize water loss. Occlusives are a group of waxy or oily ingredients that work to form a protective barrier on the surface of the skin.

Recommendation: Moisturizers and creams generally contain occlusives which gives the product a white or milky color.  After applying a hyaluronic acid serum, follow up with a moisturizer.
