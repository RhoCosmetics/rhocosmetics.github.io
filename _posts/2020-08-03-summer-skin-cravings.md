Summer is finally here! Following the warmer weather, we're inclined to change basic parts of our daily lives without much thought. We see a gradual transition in wearing lighter clothes to changing routines and diets. But what about our skincare? With warmer weather, increased humidity, and longer periods of daylight, our skin can face more challenges that require our attention. Today, we're here to shed some light on tips for improving your summer skincare routine.

Continue to Moisturize 

Although the skin can feel more greasy in the summer, it's important to keep the skin moisturized. As the weather changes, the skin can react differently to these environmental changes and stressors. Oily skin or increased sebum production may be a sign that the skin is dehydrated. When dehydrated, the skin can overcompensate and produce more sebum. 

During the summer months, try swapping out traditional moisturizers with a light-weight option or a gel textured product. Even those with dry skin can experiment with moving away from thick creams. Instead, pair your favorite moisturizer with a few drops of facial oil in the final step of your routine. 

When in Doubt, Apply SPF

Summer is all about soaking up the extra sun, but don't skip out on wearing sunscreen. Before heading out, be sure to apply a broad spectrum SPF of 30 or higher. The skin is the largest organ of our body and is the first line of defense to the environment. Wearing a broad spectrum sunscreen will help protect the skin against harmful ultraviolet rays such as UVA and UVB. 

What's the difference between these ultraviolet rays? UVAs are ultraviolet radiation that can cause damage deep into our skin, while UVBs can cause the skin to turn red and burn. Overtime, UV exposure can cause irreversible damage to the skin. Start with prevention by using SPF instead of relying on treatments as a backup to skin concerns in the future. Your skin will thank you. 

Refresh by Exfoliating

Keeping the skin feeling refreshed can mean more than applying aloe vera gel or cucumbers all over the face. Exfoliation is nothing to shy away from, especially in the summer months. Chemical exfoliators such as beta hydroxy acids are oil loving ingredients that work to help loosen and remove oil and dead skin cells from clogged pores. The most common type of BHA comes in the form of salicylic acid which can also be used to help redness, inflammation, and acne related issues.  

Like with any type of exfoliation, it's important to follow up with sunscreen. Exfoliation can speed up the skin's natural renewal process. During this time, it's paramount to protect the skin from the sun damage, which means being consistent with applying a broad spectrum sunscreen.
